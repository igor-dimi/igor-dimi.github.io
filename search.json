They can not coexist in the same heart.\nWe must push hatred, anger, cruelty, lust and jealousy out of our hearts; only then will there be room for love to enter.\nYes, it is not easy to forgive people who wronged us, to love our ‘enemies’. But that is the whole struggle, that is what life is all about."
