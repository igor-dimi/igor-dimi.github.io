Some say love and hate are two sides of the same coin, that the line dividing them is thin.
I couldn't disagree more. Love and hate are two opposing, antithetical forces. They can not coexist in the same heart.

We must push hatred, anger, cruelty, lust and jealousy out of our hearts; only then will there be room for love to enter.

Yes, it is not easy to forgive people who wronged us, to love our 'enemies'. 
But that is the whole struggle, that is what *life* is all about. [^1]
